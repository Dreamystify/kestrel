# Kestrel Configuration
#
# The keys below use the Redis hash tag format `{tag}` (e.g., `{kestrel}`).
# This ensures that in a Redis Cluster environment, all keys (shard ID, lock, and sequence)
# map to the same hash slot. This is CRITICAL for the Lua script to execute atomically
# across these keys on a single node.
#
# If you change the tag inside {}, ensure it is consistent across all keys.
